# Email Spam Classifier ðŸš€

A machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Python, Flask, and TF-IDF + Naive Bayes. The project includes a web interface for real-time predictions and demonstrates practical application of ML and web development skills.

---

## Features

- Train a spam detection model using a sample email dataset
- Real-time spam prediction via a web interface built with Flask
- User-friendly input form with dynamic prediction results
- Model persistence using `pickle` for efficient loading

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Naive Bayes)
- HTML/CSS (for web interface)
- pandas (data preprocessing)
